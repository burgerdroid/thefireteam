Organized Crimes (OCs)
===

1. All members are required to participate in OCs
2. If you are not in an OC, join one ***(Except Pet Project)***
The payout for Pet Project is low and requires a consumable, dog treats, which cost more than your potential take. It also requires a $10 million net. You’ll never make that money back.
3. Pay attention to the OC start time. All members in an OC must be in Torn for the OC to start. Time your travel well. There will be penalties for delaying an OC detailed below. It’s disrespectful to your fellow members to make them wait for you. It wastes their time that could be spent doing other Torn activities.
4. Only take roles where your success rate is green. This increases the chances for a successful OC. 
5. If you don’t have a required item, ask in faction chat or Discord. Some one has one that they can loan, give, or sell cheap. 
6. Spend all available nerve doing regular crimes in order to level them up and gain Crime Experience (CE). Increasing your CE eventually increases your maximum natural nerve (NN). NN is your base nerve before faction and merit bonuses are applied. Higher NN is one of the factors that helps increase your OC role success rate.
7. Penalties:  In Torn, time is money. Being a few minutes late to an OC is forgivable, but any more and you will start getting docked pay from the OC payout. This pay will be split amongst your OC partners. 
8. Guides - [there are several guides available](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=threads&t=16451245) in the Torn forums. Read them to get a better idea about how OCs work. There is no penalty for failing an OC beyond no payout and no faction XP. You could waste a consumable item if the OC fails after its use.
