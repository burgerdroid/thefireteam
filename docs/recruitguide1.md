Recruit Guide: Levelling, Attacking, and Training
---

## Levelling Up

The most important thing to do as a new player is to reach level 15. At that level you are able to travel, and travelling is where you start making easy mony by buying plushies and flowers, and selling them for huge profit. Not hundreds or thousands, but millions per day.

To level up you need to attack and beat other players. It is best to attack inactive players as they won't retaliate. Once your battle stats are high enough, you will be able to beat targets that will allow you to increase your level.


## Attacking

Unless our faction is in a war, we advise not to attack an active player. Active players will retaliate, have friends/faction mates that will retaliate, place bounties on you, and generally make your torn life difficult. Simply ignore attacks you receive, keep your money safe, your mouth shut, and the attackers will soon tire of bothering you. Ignore this advice at your peril.

To quickly level up, use the levelling targets. These targets are found at the “Levelling Targets” link on the “My Faction” page. These are inactive players. You will not have to worry about them retaliating. There are 3 options when you win a battle. Leave, mug and hospitalize. Using the leave option gives you the most respect.

The levelling targets are listed by total battle stats, attack the ones with stats lower than yours. You can find your battle stats on the Torn home page. If you find it too difficult to win, attack a target with lower battle stats, or train to increase yours. The forums have several good target lists as well.


## Training

Gym gains are directly tied to your happiness level, your base happiness level is dependent on your housing. The best housing for the money is a castle. Rent one that has 1500 base happiness for a period of 7 to 30 days with the lowest total price you find. Go to the city, estate agents, rental market, and select castles.

When you move into a place with a higher base happiness level, it will take time for your happiness bar to reach full. It may take several days. You may wait to train or you can use a booster to reach full happiness quicker. Candy is an inexpensive booster. Lollipops can be bought for $25 each at the sweet shop. Each lollipop will increase happiness by 25 and booster cooldown by 30 minutes. When the booster cooldown reaches 24 hours you will have to wait to take more.

Once your happiness bar is full go to the gym and train. Start out by keeping your stats fairly balanced until you have 400,000 in each stat. After that you may want to consider specializing in one or two stats.

One thing to note about housing: if you let your current lease expire without having another property of equal to or greater base happiness level of your current residence, your happiness bar will reset back to whatever your next best residence is rated.


## Advanced Training

You can get huge training gains by using the following method. It’s not necessary when you are trying to reach level 15 but it can be very beneficial.
Before training, gather 48 candies, any candy will boost your happiness but buy the best you can afford. If you want to boost your happiness and training gains even higher, go to the item market and purchase ecstasy.

To train, start with a full energy bar. Wait for Torn time to be on the hour, 15 past the hour, 30 past the hour, or 45 past the hour. Your happiness can be over full but will reset back to full at those times. Click the clock icon at the top right or look for the time at the bottom left of every page.  Now eat 48 candies. If you have ecstasy, use it, it will double whatever your happiness level is. Go to the gym and train all your energy immediately.

There are even more efficient methods of training, they are costly so you will need to have a lot of money to do them. If you’re interested, ask, or use the Torn forums to search choco jump and happy jump.
