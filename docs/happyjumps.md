Happy Jumping
=============

## What is it?

When it comes to gym training for boosting your battle stats, your Happiness meter plays a crucial role in maximizing your gains. Happy Jumping is a technique designed to enhance these benefits by increasing your Happiness meter before you start your gym training. There are several methods to achieve this (mostly dependent on finances), allowing you to effectively boost your happiness before starting your gym training.

## The Basics

Each type of jump requires that your Energy and Happiness meters are full before commencing. For Energy, this will be either 100, or 150 if you are a donator.  Your base Happiness is dependent on where you live, so endeavour to purchase (renting is better early game) to maximumise your Happiness. Proceeding this is to use enhancers to boost your Happiness above and beyond its maximum. And finally taking an Ecstasy, which when taken, doubles your Happiness.

One very important point to remember, is that Happiness above your maximum will reduce back down to your maximum every quarter of an hour (i.e. when the time reads xx:00, xx:15, xx:30, xx:45).  A Happy Jump should be initiated immediately after one of these times.  For instance, if the time is 9:27, wait 3 minutes until the time is 9:30.  You will then have a full 15 minutes to complete your Happy Jump.


## Lolly Jumping

This is the cheapest method, good for low levels, and is the basis for the more expensive methods.

__Required Items:__

* 48 Lollipops
* 1 Ecstasy

__Method:__

1. Ensure both your Energy and Happiness are full.
2. Eat 48 Lollipops (or as many as you have if less).  Each lollipop increases Happiness by 25.  After 48 Lollipops you will have gained 1,200 Happy in addition to your base maximum Happiness.
3. Take the Ecstasy.  Your Happiness will now double.
4. Do gym training until you exhaust your Energy.


## Variations to the Basic Lollipop Jump

These variations do start to increase the costs, but it does greatly increase your gym gains.

* __Options to Increase Energy before Happy Jumping__

   Taking Xanax will raise your Energy by 250.  Unlike Happiness, Energy not reduce at the quarter of an hour.  This is a popular method for extra gains, allowing you to train for longer at the higher level of Happiness. At time of writing the market value per Xanax was about $828,000.

   Another way to gain extra Energy is to buy an Energy Refill from the Points Building.  Use this when your Energy reaches 0 to refill your Energy and continue training while your Happiness is still high.  Points costed about $34,000 at the time of writing, so 30 points for an Energy Refill costs roughly $1,000,000.

   1. Take a Xanax when your Energy is full.    
   2. Wait out the drug cool-down (roughly 6 hours) after taking the Xanax, otherwise you will not be able to take the Ecstasy to double your Happiness.
   3. Eat the 48 Lollipops
   4. Take the Ecstasy.
   5. Do the gym training until your Energy reaches 0.
   6. Go to the Points Building and use 30 points to buy an Energy Refill.
   7. Continue gym training until your Energy reaches 0 again.

## Further Advanced Methods

From here it gets more expensive or more complex.  The above methods should get you going with doing Happy Jumps for quite a while.  Once you start earning decent money, another popular enhancer is Erotic DVDs, providing a 2,500 Happiness boost.  These cost around $4,000,000 each.
