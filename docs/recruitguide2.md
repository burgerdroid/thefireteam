Recruit Guide: Education, Money, and Merits
===

## Education

Two of the most important classes to finish are in the Biology Modules. I suggest taking Introduction to Biochemistry then taking Intravenous Therapy. This will allow you to use blood bags to heal much faster and more often than with first aid kits or morphine. Note you can skip to IV Therapy immediately after finishing Introduction.

Since it takes several years to finish all the education classes it is wise to spend merits on reducing education length. Time to finish classes is reduced by 20% when you have maxed out the merits in education. Another 10% reduction is available by completing the city job of Education. You will need a job stat of 500 Intelligence to start the Education job. If you are new and don’t have any job stats yet, I suggest starting with the Army until you have sufficient stats to get the education job. The 10% reduction in education time stays with you even when you leave for another job. And lastly but most expensive another 10% reduction can be had by owning 1,000,000 shares of stock in West Side University.


## Money

**Selling losses is forbidden for members of this faction**. The reason being it costs the faction valuable respect points which are the currency used to unlock upgrades for the faction. Do not do this or you will be removed.

Going to the city and buying items to sell on the market is a great way to make money. You are allowed to buy 100 items total per day at the city shops. Bits ‘n’ Bobs sells beer and spray cans that can be sold for a nice profit, sometimes up to $2000.00 each, Big Al’s Gun Shop has pepper spray that can be sold for $1000.00 or more each and Sally’s Sweet Shop has lollipops that sell for over $500.00 each.

Always check to see what the going price on the market is before you list your items for sale. Just go to the item market and search for the item you want to list. You’ll be able to see what others are asking. Price your item at the low end of the range and it will quickly sell.

If you want to sell all your items at one time, or don’t want to pay the 3% market listing fee, purchase a bazaar or use a trader to buy your items. I will trade with you for full market price until you reach level 15 and are able to travel. We also have other traders in the faction. Ask in faction chat to find out who they are.

The quickest way to make money other than winning the lottery, is to buy a donator pack and sell it at the pawn shop. Donator packs can be purchased for $5.00 real money each. The pawn shop will buy donator packs for a little more than $23,000,000.

If you keep a lot of money in your possession, be prepared to lose some of it when you get mugged. If the mugger gets a large payout, they will most likely mug you more often. There are several ways to protect your money. One is to use the faction bank. It is safe but you must ask a banker to withdraw your funds for you. A good way to keep cash where you can access anytime you want is to buy donator packs from the item market. You can usually get them for less than $24,000,000 and the pawn shop will buy them from you for $23,500,000 each. Other methods can be used such as buying and selling stocks, buying and selling plushies and flowers on the item market.

*NOTE: The value of items may be inaccurate as the market value of items can fluctuate.*

## Merits

Merits are awarded for achieving various goals. You can see the merits you have earned  at the top left of the page. These can be used to increase a range of improvements to your stats. It is recommended to max out your Education Length first. This will save you a lot of time in the long run.
